Version 1.10.0 - 23/01/2016

- Added the ITabStrip::FinishOLEDragDrop method. It should not be used if not really needed. It can be used to hide the drag image if execution of the OLEDragDrop event takes a long time or if a message is displayed from within this event.

- FIX: The Font and MouseIcon properties could leak GDI resources.
- Initial support for Windows 8.1.



Version 1.7.0 - 21/09/2013

- Added the ITabStrip::CloseableTabsMode property.



Version 1.6.0 - 05/04/2013

- FIX: The last character of the tab text could not be used as accelerator key.
- FIX: The ResizedControlWindow event was not fired when it should have been fired.
- FIX: Drawing issues could occur if a windowless control was placed inside the control.
- Initial support for Windows 8.



Version 1.5.1 - 02/03/2012

- Fixed a memory leak that occurred during drag'n'drop if Aero drag-images have been used.
- Reimplemented the subclassing code of the VB6 samples to make it more robust.



Version 1.5.0 - 01/11/2011

- Added the ITabStripTab::hAssociatedWindow property.



Version 1.4.1 - 21/05/2011

- FIX: Disabling the control did not move the keyboard focus to the next control in the tab order.
- FIX: The ResizedControlWindow event was fired when actually nothing had changed.



Version 1.4.0 - 08/01/2011

- FIX: The control could crash when it was destroyed.
- FIX: Due do a bug in Microsoft ATL, the control could lose keyboard focus when it shouldn't. This problem occured in MDI applications only. Many thanks to Peter Schellenbach for his help.
- Switched to Visual C++ 2010 and dropped support for Windows 2000.



Version 1.3.2 - 07/11/2010

- FIX: IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription could cause crashes in other programs.



Version 1.3.1 - 02/01/2010

- Fixed a potential problem with persistance.
- Improved support for Aero drag images.
- FIX: If the control was placed on a Form for which the KeyPreview feature was activated, the Form_Key* handler didn't receive key strokes like all Alt+PgDown or Alt+Left, if the control had the keyboard focus.
- FIX: The 'shift' parameter that many events have, often missed the ALT key.
- Deploy (stripped) symbols with the binaries to make debugging easier. This are the pdb files in case you wonder.



Version 1.3.0 - 11/07/2009

- Added the ITabStrip::OLEDragImageStyle property.
- FIX: When using closeable tabs, scrolling tabs could leave some debris around the scroll buttons.
- Massively reduced the usage of GDI handles.
- It is no longer necessary to subclass the control's parent window and reflect the WM_CONTEXTMENU message to make the ContextMenu event work.
- Made some internal changes that will make it easier for me to keep binary compatibility in future.



Version 1.2.1 - 18/02/2009

- Initial support for Windows 7.
- Extended the DropDescriptionIconConstants enumeration by 'ddiUseDefault'.
- Fixed some small OLE drag'n'drop bugs.
- FIX: The TAB key didn't move the focus to the next control if the control was placed within a VB6 UserControl.
- FIX: Changing the RightToLeft property at runtime did not fully work if rtlLayout was involved.



Version 1.2.0 - 31/10/2008

- Added the _ITabStripEvents::OLEDragEnterPotentialTarget event.
- Added the _ITabStripEvents::OLEDragLeavePotentialTarget event.
- Added the _ITabStripEvents::OLEReceivedNewData event.
- FIX: The _ITabStripEvents::FreeTabData event didn't work as expected. The provided tab was always Nothing.
- FIX: The _ITabStripEvents::MouseLeave event didn't work as expected. It was raised everytime the mouse wheel was scrolled outside the control if the control had the focus.
- FIX: Ignore calls to IOLEDataObject::SetDropDescription() if the drag image is in classic style.
- FIX: It wasn't possible to change the active tab using [CTRL]+[TAB] and [SHIFT]+[CTRL]+[TAB].

- Rewrote large parts of the drag'n'drop code.
- FIX: Keyboard input wasn't processed if the control was placed within a VB6 UserControl.
- FIX: On Windows 98/ME tooltips didn't work.

- FIX: Moving the control without resizing it could lead to a control width or height of 0.
- FIX: Tooltips of contained controls could get lost.
- Changed the way how the control is drawn. This was necessary to make Windows Vista's graphic effects work.
- Improved the documentation. The categories introduced with the last release have been removed again, but now properties are displayed as such.



Version 1.0.1 - 24/03/2006

- FIX: Removing a tab with the ID 0 cleared all tab containers.
- Improved the documentation. Now there's a category "Modules" with sub categories for each class. Those sub categories are split again into "Properties", "Methods" and "Events".
